Some comments

What is a FOURCC?
    FOURCC is short for "four character code" - an identifier for a video codec,
    compression format, colour or pixel format used in media files.
    http://www.fourcc.org


Parameters for cv2.VideoWriter():
    filename - Name of the output video file.
    fourcc - 4-character code of codec used to compress the frames.
    fps	- Frame rate of the created video.
    frameSize - Size of the video frames.
    isColor	- If it True, the encoder will expect and encode colour frames.
